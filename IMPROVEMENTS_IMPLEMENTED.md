# Improvements Implemented - Mumble Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to fix the history section, export options, and calendar integration based on user feedback.

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. History Section "No Content Available" Issue
**Problem**: The history section was showing "No content available" even when recordings existed.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Title Generation**: Improved the `TranscriptionHistory` component to better handle missing or poor titles
- **Fallback Title Logic**: Added multiple fallback strategies for generating meaningful titles:
  - Use existing title if available and not "Untitled"
  - Use summary (first 50 characters) if available
  - Use first sentence of transcription if available
  - Fallback to mode-based title with date (e.g., "Tasks - Dec 28, 2024")
- **Better Data Storage**: Fixed the `saveTranscription` calls in `App.tsx` to ensure summary and tasks data are properly stored
- **Improved UI**: Enhanced the history display with:
  - Better visual indicators (different icons for tasks vs. voice memos)
  - Word count and task count subtitles
  - More descriptive empty state with helpful guidance
  - Recording count display in header

### 2. Export Options Improvements
**Problem**: Export options included CSV and JSON files that aren't user-friendly for general public.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Removed**: CSV and JSON export options
- **Added**: Professional DOCX (Microsoft Word) export functionality
- **Enhanced TXT Export**: Kept the text file option but improved formatting
- **DOCX Features**:
  - Professional document structure with headings
  - Proper formatting for title, date, transcription, summary, and tasks
  - Bold text for important elements
  - Hierarchical document structure

### 3. Calendar Integration Enhancements
**Problem**: Calendar integration needed improvement for better user experience.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Improved URL Generation**: Fixed date/time formatting for proper calendar event creation
- **Added Google Meet Support**: Dedicated button for creating Google Meet events
- **Enhanced UI**: 
  - Better visual organization with icons
  - Clear section separation with "Add to Calendar" header
