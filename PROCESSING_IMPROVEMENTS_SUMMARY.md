# Processing & Results UX Improvements Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

### 1. **Confusing Draft Recovery Modal** âœ… RESOLVED
**Problem**: When starting a new session, users were prompted to recover a previous session, which was confusing when they wanted to start fresh.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Clear draft on new process**: Added `setDraftTranscription(null)` at the start of `handleProcess()`
- **Removed unnecessary draft saving**: Eliminated the draft saving during processing since we're clearing it anyway
- **Better user experience**: Users now get a clean start when beginning a new transcription

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// In handleProcess() - Clear any existing draft when starting new process
setDraftTranscription(null);
```

### 2. **Inaccurate Progress Bar** âœ… RESOLVED
**Problem**: Progress bar jumped to 90% quickly and got stuck there, not reflecting actual processing stages.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Real progress tracking**: Progress now reflects actual processing stages:
  - **0-10%**: File preparation
  - **10-70%**: Audio transcription (with callback progress)
  - **70-100%**: Summary/content generation (with callback progress)
- **Enhanced visual feedback**: New progress indicator shows current stage with icons and descriptions
- **Stage indicators**: Visual markers show Setup â†’ Audio â†’ Analysis progression

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Updated service functions to support progress callbacks
export async function transcribeAudio(
  audioFile: File, 
  language: string = 'en', 
  onProgress?: (progress: number) => void
): Promise<{ text: string }>

// Real progress tracking in handleProcess()
setProgress(10); // File preparation
const { text: transcription } = await transcribeAudio(selectedFile, selectedLanguage, (transcriptionProgress) => {
  setProgress(10 + (transcriptionProgress * 60)); // Map to 10-70%
});
```

**Enhanced ProcessingIndicator Features**:
- Animated icons that rotate during processing
- Stage-specific messages and colors
- Visual progress stages with indicators
- Multilingual support

2. A complete list of all specific, actionable tasks mentioned or implied

The summary should be comprehensive and include:
