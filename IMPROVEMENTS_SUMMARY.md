# Mumble Tasks UI/UX Improvements Summary

## üéØ Critical Issues Addressed

### 1. **Mode Selection & State Visibility** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Users couldn't tell which mode (Article, Author, Tasks, Meeting) they were in after selection.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **New Component**: `ModeIndicator.tsx` - Shows current mode with visual indicators
- **Features**:
  - Persistent mode badge with icon and description
  - Current step indicator with color-coded badges
  - Back navigation to mode selection
  - Multilingual support (EN/NO)
  - Color-coded by mode type (blue for tasks, green for meetings, etc.)

**User Experience Impact**: Users now always know exactly which mode they're in and what step they're on.

### 2. **Language Selection Flow** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Language selection was awkwardly placed and interrupted the natural flow.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Header Integration**: Language selector moved to header as persistent element
- **Improved UX**:
  - Hover-based dropdown with flag indicators
  - No longer blocks workflow progression
  - Persistent across all pages
  - Instant switching without disrupting current work
  - Clean visual design with country flags

**User Experience Impact**: Language selection is now seamless and doesn't interrupt the user's workflow.

### 3. **Step Wizard Improvements** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Problem**: Users got lost in the multi-step process.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **New Component**: `StepProgressIndicator.tsx` - Visual progress tracking
- **Features**:
  - Interactive step navigation (click to go back to previous steps)
  - Visual progress bar with animated completion
  - Color-coded step states (active, completed, pending)
  - Step validation and smart navigation
  - Automatic data cleanup when navigating backwards

**User Experience Impact**: Users can now see their progress, navigate backwards, and understand exactly where they are in the process.
