# Calendar Integration and Personalization Improvements

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. Calendar Integration Missing from Task Items
**Problem**: No calendar buttons were available on individual task items in the ResultsSection.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Added Calendar Integration Section**: Each task now has an "Add to Calendar" section with three options:
  - **Google Calendar**: Direct link to create calendar events
  - **Google Meet**: Creates calendar events with automatic Meet links
  - **Outlook**: Direct integration with Microsoft Outlook calendar
- **Proper Date/Time Formatting**: Fixed calendar URL generation with correct date/time formatting
- **Enhanced UI**: Added icons (Calendar, Video, Users) for better visual clarity
- **Professional Event Details**: Includes task priority and "Created from Mumble Tasks" attribution

### 2. Personalization Issues Fixed
**Problem**: Tasks were written in third person ("The speaker needs to...") instead of first person, and meetings didn't identify different speakers.

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### For Tasks (Personal Assistant Mode):
- **Updated Prompts**: Modified AI prompts to write tasks in second person ("You need to...", "You should...")
- **Personal Assistant Tone**: Tasks now speak directly to the user as a personal assistant would
- **Examples of Improvement**:
  - Before: "The speaker needs to call the client"
  - After: "You need to call the client"
  - Before: "Person should review the document"
  - After: "You should review the document"

#### For Meetings (Speaker Identification):
- **Enhanced Speaker Detection**: AI now tries to identify different speakers in conversations
- **Conversational Patterns**: Analyzes voice patterns, speaking styles, and topic ownership
- **Speaker Attribution**: Uses names when mentioned, or descriptive labels (Speaker A, Speaker B, Main Presenter)
- **Structured Output**: Clearly shows who said what and who is responsible for each action
- **Examples of Improvement**:
  - Before: "The team discussed the project timeline"
  - After: "Speaker A (Project Manager) mentioned the timeline, while Speaker B (Developer) responded that..."

  <h4 className="text-sm font-medium text-gray-700 mb-2">Add to Calendar</h4>
  <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2">
    <a href={createCalendarEvent(task, 'google')}>Google Calendar</a>
    <a href={createGoogleMeetEvent(task)}>Google Meet</a>

  </div>
</div>
```

### Personalized AI Prompts
```typescript
// Personal assistant prompt for tasks:
"You are a personal assistant that analyzes voice memos...
Write all tasks as if speaking directly to the user:
- Use 'You need to...' instead of 'The speaker needs to...'
- Make it personal and direct"

// Enhanced meeting analysis:
"Try to distinguish between different speakers:
- Look for conversational patterns and dialogue cues
- Use names if mentioned, otherwise descriptive labels
- Show conversation flow: 'Speaker A mentioned...', 'Speaker B responded...'"
```
